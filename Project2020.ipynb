    "The goal of this project is to make 2 predictive models which predict wind turbine power from wind turbine speed. The two models are X and Y. \n",

    "## Linear regression\n",
    "This project will use the the linear_model function from the sklearn package to perform the linear regerssion. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes the input values (x) and generates a predicted value (y) using the formula y = ax + b, where a and b are coefficients that are fit using Ordinary Least Squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares works by choosing the coefficients that minimise the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dataset [1] https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html. The observed values are the actual target values of y and the predicted alues are the values generated by the formula y = ax + b.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing \n",
    "First the data is imported and preprocessed. The preprocessing consists in splitting up the data into feature data (x values) and labels (y values) and rehsaping the X values as the LinearRegression() from linear_model function does not take a 1D array for the X values."
